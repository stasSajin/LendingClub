# Lending Club
Some exploratory analyses on Lending Club data.

# Objectives
There are a ton of analyses on the web that explore the Lending Club Data. See examples in the list below:

- [Kaggle Scripts](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/scripts?sortBy=votes)
- [Data Science Academy](http://rpubs.com/jfdarre/119147)

A big focus in this report is on originality of ideas. I tried to steer away from anything that other people have already done, and instead dug for insights that are not immediately obvious, such as sentiment analysis of loan descriptions and creation of pre-payment features.
